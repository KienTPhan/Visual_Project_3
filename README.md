#### Mini-Challenge 1: Crowdsourcing for Situational Awareness

### Tasks and Questions:

## 1: Emergency responders will base their initial response on the earthquake shake map. Use visual analytics to determine how their response should change based on damage reports from citizens on the ground. How would you prioritize neighborhoods for response? Which parts of the city are hardest hit? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.
In this visualization, the user will see 6 line graphs, each representing a different section area in town that was affected by the earthquake. The first line graph will plot the intensity shake detected through out the time period. The user can easily see that there are four humps where the shake intensity was particularly high. Underneath that graph, the user will see another graph that represents the area (). 

## 2: Use visual analytics to show uncertainty in the data. Compare the reliability of neighborhood reports. Which neighborhoods are providing reliable reports? Provide a rationale for your response. Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.

## 2: How do conditions change over time? How does uncertainty in change over time? Describe the key changes you see. Limit your response to 500 words and 8 images.


### Propose Solution:

## 1: A line graph and a map will show the first responder which neiborhood needs what after the earthquake.

## 2: We will also use a bar chart to show the uncertainty of the data between neiborhoods as well as certain category.

## 3: Our line graph will show how the condition change over time. We will allow users to switch between range of date to show the uncertainty of the data between neiborhoods.
