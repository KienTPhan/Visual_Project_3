#### Mini-Challenge 1: Crowdsourcing for Situational Awareness

### Tasks and Questions:

## 1: Emergency responders will base their initial response on the earthquake shake map. Use visual analytics to determine how their response should change based on damage reports from citizens on the ground. How would you prioritize neighborhoods for response? Which parts of the city are hardest hit? Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.
In this visualization, the user will see 6 line graphs, each representing a different section area in town that was affected by the earthquake. The first line graph will plot the intensity shake detected through out the time period. The user can easily see that there are four humps where the shake intensity was particularly high. Underneath that graph, the user will see another graph that represents the areas (). In order for emercency responders to prioritize neighborhoods, they will use the line graphs of each damage area with the assistance of the map graph. Each row represent a certain area of the town. With these two visualizations, the user will be able to identify easily which areas need assistance first. The darker shade red on the map directs users to the most damaged areas in each location while also showing the average trend of people sending in information of damaged reports on the line graph. A user can hover over the map graph to look at the details of the location. It will display the location name, ID, and the damage value it recieved from people's reporting. If no data was in that certain area it will display "no data".

As you look over the maps, the user will notice that Location 3 is always a darker color which means that it is constantly in a damage state. This means that the responder will likely go to this location for aiding the citizens there. 
## 2: Use visual analytics to show uncertainty in the data. Compare the reliability of neighborhood reports. Which neighborhoods are providing reliable reports? Provide a rationale for your response. Limit your response to 1000 words and 10 images.
Our visualization answers this question by providing a stack bar graph to show the damage score people report for locations. On the x asix, the user will see that all the locations are displayed in numerical order, making it easy to find a location. The stack rectangles represent the damage score 0-10 (10 being the most damaged)  

## 2: How do conditions change over time? How does uncertainty in change over time? Describe the key changes you see. Limit your response to 500 words and 8 images.


### Propose Solution:



## 2: We will also use a bar chart to show the uncertainty of the data between neiborhoods as well as certain category.

## 3: Our line graph will show how the condition change over time. We will allow users to switch between range of date to show the uncertainty of the data between neiborhoods.
